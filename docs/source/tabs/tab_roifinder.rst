Tab ROI Finder
========================


The ROI Finder tab is one of the core features of Neurotorch as you can find here the synapse detector. 
ROIs (regions of interest) is a term adapted from ImageJ and is defined in Neurotorch as a region in an image 
(usually a synapse or similar structure). A ROI in ImageJ can have a variety of shapes, but Neurotorch currently
support two types: Circular and polygonal ROI.

Before you start your detection, you should carefully select proper settings
for detection.

- **Algorithm**: Here you select which algorithm you want to use for detection
- **Image Source**: Every algorithm uses some aggegration of the diffImg

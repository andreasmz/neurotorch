First steps
========================

.. note:: 
    Please note: When speaking of images, this term may be misleading as it actually refers to a series of images (video)


Data Neutoroch can work with
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neurotorch is designed to find regions of synaptic activity in microscopic videos tagged with iGluSnFR3, but is in general capable to detect any kind of local increase in brightness.
You can get some basic knowledge by reading this wikipedia article `(Glutamate-sensitive fluorescent reporter) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate-sensitive_fluorescent_reporter>`_,
but as a beginning, consider the following image

.. list-table:: 
    :widths: 50 50
    :align: center

    * - .. image:: media/sample_synaptic_activity01.gif
           :alt: Example of synaptic activity tagged with iGluSnFR3

      - .. image:: media/sample_synaptic_activity_rois_01.gif
           :alt: Detected ROIs in the image

    * - Example of synaptic activity
      - Detected ROIs in the image

Neurotorch does this by calculating the so called diffImage (see section :doc:`Difference Image </algorithm/differenceImage>` for more details)

Opening an image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To open images, you have to options: a) Directly in Neurotorch or b) Using Fiji/ImageJ.
In both cases, the image must fullfill the following criteria

1. It must have exactly a 3 dimensional shape: Time, X and Y. Tip: If you have multiply color channels,
   use ImageJ to merge them to one channel
2. It must have at least two frames

Neurotorch uses the powerful `PIMS <http://soft-matter.github.io/pims>`_ libary including BioFormats used also by Fiji/ImageJ,
which can open nearly all data formats. Nevertheless, Neurotorch was tested and verified to work with
TIFF and ND2 files, but in theory nearly all formats should work fine. 

.. warning:: 
    The connection to ImageJ in Neurotorch has a bug, as it will use the same BioFormats instance as Fiji/ImageJ and fail to start ImageJ
    if there has already been opened an BioFormats image.
    Therefore - if you need to use BioFormats (for example for nd2) - you should start Fiji/ImageJ first.

Using Neurotorch to open images, you may choose to "Open noisy image", which is just a shortcut to apply Denoising with the default Ïƒ.
If you choose ImageJ, note that you can send the image to Neurotorch using "ImageJ --> Neurotorch" in the menubar under "ImageJ".

.. warning:: 
    Neurotorch requires at least twice (with denoising three times) as much memory as the unpacked file. But generating the ImageViews 
    (specially the median and standard deviation) will consume temporarily nearly double the RAM. So consider at least 5x the file size
    of free RAM before opening any image.
